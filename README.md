This is my private repo where i will be practicing DSA in c++

Algorithims and data structures that i want to implement:

algos:
- binary search [x]
- linear search [x]
- bubble sort [x]
- selection sort [x]
- insertion sort [x] 
- quick sort [x]
- merge sort [ ]
- bfs/dfs for trees and graphs [x]
- dijkstra algoritm [x]

ds:
- queue [x]
- stack []
- doubly linked list [x]
- ring buffer []
- binary tree [x]
- graphs [x]
- heaps [x]
- LRU cache
